### iOSab build canny lines
builds a branch named iOSab-canny+lines which contains a merged build of the two branches

# git diff --name-status canny..lines

Outputs modified/added/deleted files
	M       CardCV.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
	M       CardCV/SVViewController.h
	M       CardCV/SVViewController.mm
	A       CardCV/UIImage+OpenCV.h
	A       CardCV/UIImage+OpenCV.mm
	M       CardCV/en.lproj/MainStoryboard.storyboard

Optionally replace main AppDelegate with one that provides a UI to choose which version to use 

All files from both branches are added to one new branch eg: canny-lines
Can ignore *.pbxproj
Modified classes get specified to branch eg SVViewController->canny_SVViewController
Differing categories have to have overlapping methods be renamed, and each class using those methods must specify which one they were using
Added/Deleted categories can be ignored
Modified xibs must be specified to the project ala classes
Modified storyboards must be specified and the AppDelegate must choose which storyboard to use (also set storyboard in plist to be blank)

For overlapping classes:
	rename each eg: SVViewController
	canny_SVViewController
	lines_SVViewController
	create a container proxy SVViewController which chooses which implementation to use depending on the test

Add all newly created files to xcodeproj

Next steps:
	Pull in second branch
	Replace ABViewController with chooser
	Create a diff file to add renamed versions of ABViewController to xcodeproj
